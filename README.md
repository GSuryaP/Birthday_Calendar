# Birthday_Calendar
The Python script implements a "Social Calendar" application using Tkinter for the GUI. It connects to a MySQL database named 'CSProject' to manage birthday records. The interface offers two modes:

Admin Mode: Allows admins to:
  View All Birthdays: Display all records in a table.
  Add Records: Insert new birthday entries with ID, name, month, and date.
  Delete Records: Remove entries by ID.
  Update Records: Modify existing birthday details.
  
User Mode: Enables users to:
  View All Birthdays: See the complete list.
  View Specific Birthdays: Select a date using a calendar widget to view relevant birthdays.

The application uses images for backgrounds, handles database operations with feedback via message boxes, and ensures a user-friendly experience through organized window navigation and input validation.
